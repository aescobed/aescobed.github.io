        Below are some examples of macros which I have made for companies that work with SolidWorks on a daily basis. Most of the macros use recursion to cover the entire part.

            This macro has several functionalities. It takes information from a database stored in Microsoft Access to auto fill fields in the first userform. It sets the custom properties of the part using the information
            in the userform. It then deletes the bend radii and saves the part as a step file to remove the features before saving it into the appropriate folder set by the user as a part file again. Finally, it allows the user to set
            a view orientation after tilting or rotating the part.

            This macro detects all the holes within a part, lists them out, and lets you select any which you would like to adjust. You can also select the holes on the part itself, and press 'get selected holes' to see the size of the holes you selected and only adjust those ones. Note that the adjust holes feature which is created also tells you the new diameter of the hole(s).

            This macro deletes all the bend radii in a sheet metal part by recursively scanning through all the faces and comparing the normal vectors from the faces to determine if there is a bend.
