    <div id="desc2">
        During my undergraduate experience I spent close to two years working in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) lab at UBCO. Below is a small insight into some of the work I acheived in that research group.

        <img id="mesh" src="images\CFD\Structured Mesh.JPG" width="800" height="500" align="middle" style="float: right; margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:50px; margin-right:200px; margin-top:10px;border: solid black 2.5px">
        <p id="CADdesc">
            I first designed a volute which was meant to add swirl to the flow before entering the tesla turbine. This was done by creating the geometry in Solidworks and then meshing it for the simulations.
        </p>

    <div>
        <img id="streamlines" src="images\CFD\Volute Streamlines.png" width="800" height="500" align="middle" style="float: right; margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:100px; margin-right:200px; margin-top:10px;border: solid black 2.5px">
        <p id="CADdesc">
            Here you can see the effect of the volute on the streamlines and how the flow begins to swirl around the annulus. This is done so that the Tesla turbine (turboexpander) can extract the energy from the flow within its cylinders.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <img id="pressure" src="images\CFD\Pressure.png" width="800" height="500" align="middle" style="float: right; margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:90px; margin-right:200px; margin-top:10px;border: solid black 2.5px">
        <p id="CADdesc">
            I analyzed results of the volute extensively. Here you can see the pressure gradient of the fluid as it enters the chamber.
        </p>

        <img id="Disks" src="images\CFD\Disks Streamlines.png" width="800" height="500" align="middle" style="float: right; margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:100px; margin-right:200px; margin-top:0px;border: solid black 2.5px">

        <p id="CADdesc">
            Once I finished the volute, I then spent a great deal of time performing simulations on the turboexpander which was to be placed at the end of the volute I designed. I was very fortunate to use the in-house solver developed by a member of my research group to produce insightful results. I was able to add some code to his C scripts to get a better understanding of the results. I derived the equation for efficiency and added that to the code as well as several other post processing techniques.
